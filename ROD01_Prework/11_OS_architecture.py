The Architecture of an Operating System
=======================================

Today's software, and with it, modern devices cannot exist without an
operating system. An operating system is a type of software that allows you
to manage your computer system. The modern system consists of several layers:

Users get to interact with:
- Applications
- Utilities
- OS
- Hardware

The lowest level is the hardware layer. Above it is the operating system
that manages and controls the use of hardware and peripheral devices. This
is done with the help of utilities and application software. From the user's
point of view, the operating system provides the environment to run utility
applications such as office programs, games and web browsers. There are many
different types of operating systems which are dependent on the type of
application, computer system, hardware, e.g. desktop computer, mobile phone.

Operating Systems just computers have a layered structure:
----------------------------------------------------------
- Shell
- Kernel
- Drivers
- Hardware

Drivers are special type of software that mediate communication between
the hardware and the rest of the operating system. The kernel is the main
part of the operating system that is responsible for all of its activities.
The shell is the top layer and acts as an intermediary between the user and
the operating system. It gives the user the ability to use the operating
system. In other words this is where the user communicates with the
operating system. Coatings can be distinguished into graphic and text based
shells.

WINDOWS
-------
It is the most popular operating system in the world. Developed by
Microsoft, it's name comes from the characteristic window like mode of
operations. Operating systems from the Windows family are intended for both
home and professional use. Windows allows you to work with a graphical user
interface (GUI), as well as through a special type of text shell, such as:
- GUI
- Command line = Command Prompt
- Powershell

LINUX
-----
Linux is an operating system developed by the Finnish programmer Linus
Torvalds. It was created as free software. Its source code is publicly
available and can be modified by users. As a result, there are currently
many Linux distributions (versions) on the market, and the future of Linux
will depend only on the needs of it's users. Due to the open source nature,
rich library of additional packages, high security and stability, Linux is
used in many solutions, such as e-mail and web servers or databases. The
largest corporate banks operate on Linux. As in Windows, there is a
graphical user interface (although you can use a system with a text
interface only) and a special text interface, the so-called Terminal.
- GUI
- Terminal

MacOS
-----
MacOS is an operating system from the Unix family (similar to Linux). It is
officially available only for devices manufactured by Google. The strengths
of macOS include: efficiency, a simple user interface, less malware - like
viruses and Trojans - compared to other operating systems. Like Linux,
macOS has access to the graphics mode and the text equivalent of a terminal.
- GUI
- Terminal
