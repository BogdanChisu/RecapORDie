AGILE
======

IT dominated by "agile" technologies which determine how development teams
should work.

Waterfall (Cascade) Model
-------------------------
Precursor to Agile

Requirements (customer)
    Design (based on the requirements)
        Implementation (programming phase)
            Testing (going to maintenance phase)
                Implementation

In the 1990s based on the 10 dominant methodologies a new method began to
appear based on more lightweight management processes and greater
adaptability of the project.

In 2001 17 programmers wrote a document known as the "Agile Manifesto":

==============================================================================
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping
others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
- Individuals and interactions - over processes and tools.
- Working software - over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration - over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change - over following a plan.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items
on the left more...
==============================================================================

Kent Beck   James Grenning  etc.

Agile methodologies:
--------------------
- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming
- Lean Development

The most common methodology used by IT companies is SCRUM
----------------------------------------------------------
In SCRUM, the work of the development team is divided into iterations
lasting from one to four weeks called "sprints".
At the beginning of the sprint a goals is set to determine what they want to
achieve in this period. Goals are set and the team tries to solve all the
planned tasks.
Developers get together for short daily meetings called "stand-ups" in which
they described what they worked on yesterday, what they will work on today
and whether they encountered any problems that threaten the feasibility of
the sprint goal.
At the end of the spring the team reflects on the achievement of the
goal and reflects on whether the organization of their work needs to be
adjusted.

Scrum Roles
-----------

Product Owner - mediates between the development team and the client. He is
responsible to define and prioritize tasks for the team based on customer
requirements.

Scrum Master:
    - Conducts Scrum meetings
    - Ensures that the team adheres to the agreed process
    - Tries to protect the team from anything that could disrupt its
    productivity

Neither Product Owner nor Scrum Master play a management role in the team.
