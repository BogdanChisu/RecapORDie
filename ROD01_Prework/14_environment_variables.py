Environment Variables
=====================

Operating systems often contain a lot of application programs that require
different software to run, e.g. a programming language or an additional library.
System variables have been created to speed up communication between software
and to speed up the way a user runs software. A variable in its definition is a
certain object in which we can store a value.
