TEXT ENCODING
=============

Text encoding origins traced to electric telegraph using MORSE Code.
Short electric impulses: dot
Long electric impulses: dash

MORSE CODE:
-----------

The length of a dot is one unit.
The length of a dash is three units.
The space between parts of the same letter is one unit.
The space between letters is three units.
The space between words is seven units.

BAUDOT CODE - ITA1 1888 Aug. 21
-----------
Each letter consisted of a combination of five electrical pulses (5 bit code).
International Telegraph Alphabet: ITA2(1924)

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange
----------------------------------------------------------
60's twentieth century
Text coding on computers
7 bit format code => 128 possible characters

ISO 8859-2 extended ASCII for all languages in central Europe
8 bit format code => 256 possible characters

Unicode
-------
Set of characters for all languages => 143859
Several various encodings UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32
UTF = Unicode Transformation Format
Each character is represented in a maximum of 4 bytes.
