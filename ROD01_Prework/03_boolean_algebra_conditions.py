BOOLEAN ALGEBRA AND CONDITIONS
------------------------------

One of the frequent elements of programming is the conditional statement
which allows us to execute some code only when a certain condition is met.

e.g.:
You will only allow a customer to make a money transfer if the balance on
their account is greater than zero.

Learning programming we will encounter situations which are handled with
boolean values and operators. A boolean value can assume one of two states:
TRUE or FALSE.

BOOLEAN OPERATORS
------------------

AND, & or && - Used when we want to make sure that two different conditions
                are true at the same time
OR, | or ||  - Used in situations where we need only one in two conditions
                to be
                true
NOT, !      - used to negate a boolean value
XOR         - returns true only if one of the two values is true
NAND        - returns true only if the two values are FALSE at the same time
NOR         - returns true only if both of the two values are false at the same
                time

Boolean Algebra is very important for electronics.
Logic Gates are used for building circuits that execute complex operations
such as adding and subtracting numbers.
