Computers are everywhere
------------------------

From mobile phones, laptops, cash registers and servers.
Traffic lights are controlled by computers.

Programmers create sets of instructions that determine the actions performed
by the computer.

IT industries:
--------------
1. Web dev
2. Mobile dev
3. Game dev (console and computer dev)
4. Embedded dev

'Every company is now a tech company'

Programming languages mediate between a programmers instructions and the
instructions of the CPU.

LOW LEVEL LANGUAGES => programming languages closer to machine instructions
    They are harder to use but offer more control over the device.
    Lower memory consumption.
    Higher performance
    Preferred by gaming industry due to performance
    Embedded industry, where they are fewer available resources.

HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES => characterized by more abstraction and are easier and
faster to write software use
    Are used in places where the speed of application development is more
    important than the speed of operation:
        - reservation system for plane tickets

TIOBE Index May 2020:
1. C
2. Java
3. Python
4. C++
5. C#

COMPILATION
-----------
Some languages allow you to run the written code only after translating the
entire program into machine code - sequences of 1 and 1 that are
understandable to the computer.
C, C++ are compiled languages

INTERPRETED LANGUAGES
---------------------
The source code in interpreted languages is read by a program called the
INTERPRETER and translated into machine code 'on the fly' and executed.
Although programs that run in this way are usually less efficient than
compiled programs they make the programmers life easier in various ways:
    1. A programmer does not have to wait for the entire program to be
    compiled to validate one line of code
